# Guiela UI

This is the API source code for Guiela, an Open source project built on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework for automated bank reconciliations. This is a two part application that totally separates the business logic from the user interface, an idea implemented to enable the Developer Circle team participate solely on the code base they are familiar with without having to deal with alien code.

## Project setup

### Requirement
- Laravel Please visit [laravel.com](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x) for more information on Laravel Framework requirements.
- PHP >= 7.2.0
- Composer

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine and from the root directory of the application run the following command:

```
composer install
```

This will take a few seconds to install all the dependencies required to run the application.

**Note that development environments vary, so if there is an error during this process please go through the error output messages to learn the cause of the problem, knowing the problem will help your research on how to fix it.**

## Configuration
After installation, create a .env file in the root directory then copy and paste the contents of .env.example to it.

### Start server

Start the development server by running the following:

```
php artisan serve
```
Now check for the port on the command line terminal to know where our application is available, e.g. `http://localhost:8000/` and visit it via the browser.
